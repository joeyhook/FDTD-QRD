# FDTD-QRD

2D model of a cross-section of a quadratic residue diffusor using finite difference methods.
Width and depth dimensions, along with sequence length are variable. 
The incident signal is also variable (Gauss, noise, delta, sine, etc.) and from infinite distance (plane wave)
The diffusor is 'perfectly' reflective and the outer walls are 'perfectly' absorptive
3 different variations of the code show changing frequency of source, changing sequence length, changing number of sequences.
