# FDTD-QRD

2D model of a cross-section of a quadratic residue diffusor using finite difference methods.
The simulation is animated and a circular 'mic array' output is plotted.

Width and depth dimensions, sequence length of diffusor, and input signal are variable. 
The incident signal (Gauss, Hann, noise, delta, sine, etc.) is a plane wave simulating infinite distance from source to diffusor.
Selecting 'Sine' repeats the simulation multiple times over a range of frequencies, including comparison to a flat surface.
The diffusor is 'perfectly' reflective and the outer walls are 'perfectly' absorptive.
